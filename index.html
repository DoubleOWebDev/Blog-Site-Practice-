    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
    <p>
        HTML stands for HyperTextMarkupLanguage. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language).

        HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video,etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.
